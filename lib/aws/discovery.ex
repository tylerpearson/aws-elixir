  AWS Application Discovery Service

  AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration
  projects by automatically identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs),
  software, and software dependencies running in your on-premises data
  centers. Application Discovery Service also collects application
  performance data, which can help you assess the outcome of your migration.
  The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely retained in
  an AWS-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export the data as
  a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration
  solution to plan your migration. For more information, see [AWS Application
  Discovery Service FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/).

  Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:

  <ul> <li> **Agentless discovery** mode is recommended for environments that
  use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an
  agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information
  regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for
  initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't
  collect information about software and software dependencies. It also
  doesn't work in non-VMware environments.

  </li> <li> **Agent-based discovery** mode collects a richer set of data
  than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent,
  which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent
  captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory
  of installed software applications, system and process performance,
  resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads. The
  information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
  Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

  </li> </ul> We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware
  environments and to collect information about software and software
  dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery
  simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to quickly complete the initial
  infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select hosts.

  Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery
  solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. Third-party application
  discovery tools can query Application Discovery Service and write to the
  Application Discovery Service database using a public API. You can then
  import the data into either a visualization tool or cloud-migration
  solution.

  <important> Application Discovery Service doesn't gather sensitive
  information. All data is handled according to the [AWS Privacy
  Policy](http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). You can operate Application
  Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared
  with the service.

  </important> Your AWS account must be granted access to Application
  Discovery Service, a process called *whitelisting*. This is true for AWS
  partners and customers alike. To request access, [sign up for Application
  Discovery Service](http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/).

  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for
  each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The
  topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
  Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is
  tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
  more information, see [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
